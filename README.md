# PDW-perturbations

## Purpose
In this repository are all the files used to generate and analyze the data presented in "Dynamic Stability of Passive Dynamic Walking Following Unexpected Perturbations". The files are in a much cleaner and more readable form than they were when generating data for the manuscript. None of the functionality was changed -- only file names and code readability/cleanliness. 

## Data Generation 
The main files in this folder are "perturb_pdw.m" and "collect_data.m," which encompass the data generating and synthesizing process. 

## Analysis
The main files in this folder are "pert_percent_histograms.m," "fallstephistogram.m," "linear_classify_clean.m," "kinematics_compare.m," and "HeatmapGrey.m". These were the files used to create the figures included in the manuscript. The other files are either auxilliary functions for those previously mentioned, or other pieces of analysis. 

## Brewermap colors
This folder is copied from the GitHub repository "DrosteEffect/BrewerMap" to assist in creating quality figures.
